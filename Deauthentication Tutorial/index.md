## Overview

In this tutorial, you‚Äôll learn how to:
- Enable monitor mode on a wireless adapter
- Use `airodump-ng` to find nearby Access Points and connected devices
- Target a specific AP and identify connected clients (stations)
- Use `aireplay-ng` to deauthenticate a client, useful for WPA handshake capture

## Prerequisites

- A computer running **Kali Linux**
- A **wireless adapter that supports monitor mode and packet injection**
  - In this lab I leverage the **HAK5 MK7AC WiFi Adapter**
- An access point that can use the WPA2-Personal protocol **AND** is using the 2.4GHz transmission frequency
  - In this lab I leverage the **NETGEAR R6400-100NAS** *Circa 2017*
*Note this lab hinges on these two commponents. I would recommend using an older router**
- Tools that already should be included in Kali:
  - `airmon-ng`
  - `airodump-ng`
  - `aireplay-ng`
- Superuser (`sudo`) privileges

## üõ∞Ô∏è Step 1: Enable Monitor Mode

First, identify your wireless interface:

```bash
iwconfig
